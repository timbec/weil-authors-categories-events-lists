Weil Categories Authors Events Widgets

This combines three plugins into one: Authors List, Categories List and Events, and generates three widgets.

replaces the following:
    - Authors Widget
    - AVH Extended Categories Widgets
    - WP Category Post List Widget

This plugin generates three widgets:
    - Weil Upcoming Events Widget
    - Weil Author Display Widget
    - Weil Category List Widget

These widgets can be used like any other widget.
Some modifications:
- Categories and Authors do NOT display authors and categories with no posts attached.
- Events are drawn from posts with the 'events' category selected (the slug MUST read 'events' which I believe in BFR blog is actually named 'Upcoming Events'. Check the category in the editor). If no posts are checked with the event slog, the sidebar widget (on the front end) will not appear.
